# APLR
**Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression**

## About
APLR allows you to build predictive and interpretable regression or classification machine learning models in Python, using the Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression (APLR) methodology developed by Mathias von Ottenbreit. APLR often rivals tree-based methods in predictive accuracy, while offering smoother, more interpretable predictions. 

For further details, see the [documentation](https://github.com/ottenbreit-data-science/aplr/tree/main/documentation). You may also read the published article for additional insights: [Link 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-024-01475-4) and [Link 2](https://rdcu.be/dz7bF). Additional functionality has been added since the article was published.

## Installation
To install APLR, use the following command:

```bash
pip install aplr
```

To include dependencies for plotting, use this command instead:

```bash
pip install aplr[plots]
```

## Availability
APLR is available for Windows, most Linux distributions, and macOS.

## Usage
Example Python scripts are available [here](https://github.com/ottenbreit-data-science/aplr/tree/main/examples).
